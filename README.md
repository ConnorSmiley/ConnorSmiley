# Welcome to my Profile!

### Who am I?

I started my career as a graphic designer, at a studio called Moxie Sozo, located in Boulder, Colorado. With little knowledge of programming, I knew I needed to keep my skills competitive. Learning front-end web developer has been an eye-opener. Currently, I am testing out I.T. as I enjoy the physical hardware of technology.
